// Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the 
// top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right
// corner. You may only move down or right.

// In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with 
// dimensions m * n?

// Write a function 'gridTraveler(m,n)' that calculates this.

const gridTraveler = (m, n) => {
